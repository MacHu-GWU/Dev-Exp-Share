==============================================================================

- User Pool: User pools are user directories that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users.
- Identity Pool: Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to other AWS services.
- You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.


App Authentication Workflow:

1. Authentication and get tokens from User pool
2. Exchange tokens for AWS Credentials
3. Access AWS Service with credentials
