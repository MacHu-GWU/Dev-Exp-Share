### Behavior Questions (BQ)

常用缩写:

- tmat: tell me a time

#### Teamwork - Collaboration

##### BQ: tmat you wish you'd handle a situation differently with a colleague?


#### Teamwork - Conflict Handling


##### BQ: tmat you find your coworker made a huge error infront of clients.

你和你的 Team 在给对外的客户做 Demo 的时候, 当你发现你的队友的 Presentation 出现了错误, 你会怎么做. 

- 如果错误是 Giving the wrong guy the credit. 我认为这是内部的事情, 可以在我们回到公司后通过沟通解决.
- 如果事实性错误, 会误导客户做出错误的预期. 我不会打断他, 我会在最后说, May I add one things? 然后试图修正客户对我们的预期.
- 如果是明显的 Yes No 的错误, 我会 Silently 告诉 product owner / manager 提醒这里有个错误, 让他去补充.

**S (Situation)**:

- 我们在做一个 1 年的 BLS 的 Contract, 为他们搭建 Data Collection, Data Lake and Data Analytics 的系统. 我是 Architecture 和 Engineer 的 Mentor.
- 有次我们在对 BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) 的 Demo 中, 我们的 Engineer 宣称我们要用 ECS 来部署 Scalable 的 App, 并说了基于 ECS 详细的开发计划.

**T (Task)**:

- 但 ECS 只是我们内部的 Best Practice, 我们的 timeline, budget 不支持我们用 ECS, 并且客户的 Knowledge 并不能掌控 ECS.
- 我们不能让客户对我们的 deliverable 有错误的预期.

**A (Action)**:

- 我在最后的时候我补充了一下, 说明了如果用 ECS 还有很多复杂的事需要做, 比如 deployment strategy, dockerization, provisioning strategy. 说明了为什么如果用 ECS, 我们的 timeline 会很紧急.
- 我补充了 backup plan B, 使用 AWS Batch + EC2 + Docker 来部署. 从 App 的角度上足够支持我们 1 年内的 traffic, 同时客户本身的 knowledge 对 EC2 也比较熟悉.

**R (Result)**:

- 这样并没有 undermine 我同事的工作, 也表现了我们有 plan B, 考虑周全, 赢得了用户的信任.

##### BQ: tmat you handle a conflict with your team member.

**S (Situation)**

- 我们公司经常要做 demo
- 我们最近招了个 new hire

**T (Task)**

- 他老在 Demo 的时候 undermine 我的 presentatiion, 比如说: have you ever considered using xyz, I think xyz is better...
- 我想要 focus on business value, 而不像浪费时间给客户解释, 这让我很生气.

**A (Action)**

- calmdown 之后我想了下, 之所以他会提出各种 alternative answer, 说明他是一个愿意 take initiative, 而且 enbrace challenge
- 我如果应用得到, 这些 bad behavior 可以变成他的 motivation, 提供更多的 engineering value
- 我跟他谈话了, 说了他的 alternative 想法很好, 我们以后在 demo 的时候不要说, 而是结束后说这个话题, 就像现在这样
- 我要他谈谈他的想法, 并且 assign 他一个工作让他去做一个 poc, 然后我 design 了一些 usecase 要求做 benchmark testing
- 我 review 了他的 work 之后, 让他自己做一个关于自己的 work 的 presentation

**R (Result)**

- 我如果 keep being angry, 不会给我们增加任何 value
- 他也变成了一个非常 productive individual contributor


#### Teamwork - Leadership

##### BQ: tmat you motivate 

#### Teamwork - Communication

##### BQ: Describe a situation in which you were able to use persuasion to successfully convince someone to see things your way

**S (Situation)**:
   
- My current company Enquizit have a Partner Maximum, are **trying to win a big USCIS Contract**.
- Enquizit send **me as Senior Engineer to support this project**.
- We need to build a **Document Management System** with Web GUI, back end data crawler, Machine Learning App.
- We form a 20 peopels team and rent a big conference room for 2 weeks.

**T (Task)**:

- Their lead engineer **decide to use GraphQL for backend data model**, because those documents are highly related. But I have different opinion.
- But I observed that their other engineers are not familiar with GraphQL before.
- Front end engineer and Data Analytics also required to interact to backend database in this project.
- Their lead engineer was in vacation and actually made this decisioin remotely, he haven't give any implementation of sample query to answer business question.
 
**A (Action)**:

- First day, I made big progress on data crawler independently, **build trust and close relationship with their engineer team**.
- I **raised my concerns** and **suggest their developer to develop a POC data model** with fake data Sample Query, at same time, I developed my equavilent data model and database backend.

**R (Result)**:

- Other engineers gives negative feedback on GraphQL and positive feedback on My Data Model
- People are convinced that we should do this project in my Way.

#### Management - Decision Making

##### BQ: tmat you have to PUSH BACK or CHALLENGED a DECISION

**S (Situation)**:

- Our CEO been called that, our partner company Maximus Federal wants my help in a tech challenge from USCIS (Immigration). If we delivered the sample app in 10 days, we could receive a contract that can support a 80 engineers teams. They know me because I worked with them before and my Infrastructure Deployment framework became their internal standard before.
- It is about to build a dossier management system, and the document and user's inter relationship are critical. Their Chief Architect Mr Chris decided to use Graph Database and Graph QL, because its the best solution to query relationships, and he claim that they can use a properly designed Schema to simulate Graph Database in relational database.

**T (Task)**:

- I strongly disagree with this decision:
    - I am the only developer who has Graph Database AWS Neptune and Graph Experience.
    - There developer engineers doesn't have much experience and not very productive.
    - Their Chief Architect only came up the ER diagram, but the schema and query are not tested at all.
    - Their Chief Architect are on vacation and he only plan to give people high level guide and review the POC reply before we submit.
    - Intuitively I think we can not meet the timeline using that.
- Since their Chief Architect are not very active and no one can make technique decision their, I plan to convince the product owner to let me lead the development of this project. but I have concerns, that I have to choose not to challenge it until I have an alternative solution:
    - We are a team of 10 engineers, and 5 other collaborative and management peoples, only me and my buddy Mike are the only two from Enquizit. I don't want to challenge him directly.
    - Their Engineer Manager and their Senior DevOps engineer knows my skill sets very well, but their VP which is the product owner and other engineer don't. **I have to convince them first**.
    - I have to **came up an alternative design** in Relational database and writing the queries in a mock database to validate my solution.
    - I have to minimize the impact of the Graph Database design before I claim my solution.

**A (Action)**:

- **Convince them**: There's a important requirement that use web crawler to collect dossier from multiple data source. We rent a conference room for 10 days for this project. When I arrive there office spent a whole day for the web crawler design. I implemented the crawler and deployed to AWS with my own framework in two hours and get all required data crawled in a structured format. And I gave their Data Scientist instruction of what model and what feature engineering we could use to show case the business value. I impressed their engineer team and management team. The Engineer Manager then recommend me to their VP that let me lead the development work.
- **Minimize the Impact**: The second day, I assigned different works like: 1> writing mock API request 2> create unittest 3> prepare mock data 4> setup centralized parameter store 4> the Infrastructure as Code template 5> feature engineering to their engineer. All these are not depends on the database and data modeling. It give me buffer time to came up the alternative design.
- **Came up the Design**:

**R (Result)**:

##### BQ: tmat another team member DISAGREE WITH YOUR DECISION

**S (Situation)**:

- When I was Junior AWS Solution Architect, a Senior 

I remember that when I was doing development as Junior AWS Solution Architect, there's a guy Matt happens to be sitting with me. We are not on the same project. But he come to my desk very often and says something like: "the way you manage your config file is so dumb", "if I am your manager see that you are doing security group this way, you got fired", "you should do it this way balabala".

At beginning, I feel not comfortable, I didn't say anything, and eventually I see that, his suggestion is right.

After that I observed a lots of entry level engineer coming to his desk, and asking question, like learning Linux system, shell scripting. He use a lots of offensive words in his talk, but he is really patient in explaining technique details to others. Finally I realize that he is not offending people on purpose, this is his style of humor. And he is actually a nice person and willing to help other with his own time.

**T (Task)**:

**A (Action)**:

- I learned a lots of "best practice" example for DevOps, maintaining a cluster, Automate Infrastructure as Code, Hybrid Cloud Network strategy. I can say that without his help, I cannot grow that fast in DevOps expertise.
- I also did a small project writing a plugin for Terraform with him, and in the peer code review process, I learned a lots good code pattern.

**R (Result)**:

- I used to struggling that I already have Data Analytics, Data Engineering, Software Development skills, and I really want to learn DevOps as well, but there's no easy way, because a lots of good practice are from working experience. With Matt's help, I become a qualified DevOps engineer, and Now in my current Job, I did most of the DevOps jobs setting up CI/CD pipeline, doing config management, and writing automation scripts.


##### BQ: Give me an example of a time when you used your fact-finding skills to solve a problem.
    
**S (Situation)**:

- login.gov is Government powered Single-Sign-On service
- I play Data Engineer and Data Analytics role in this project, build ETL pipeline, maintain data warehouse and do some analytics

**T (Task)**:

- We **observed abnormal unsuccessful rate in the sign-up new account workflow**, we want to figure out why.
- I observe that when user are from external site usajob, the UI highlight is missleading. It suppose to highlight Sign-In, but not Create an Account. Because they land this page from a button (Already had login.gov acccount)

**A (Action)**:

- I used two method: **funnel view and bayesian analysis**.
- It clearly show that we lose a lot of sessions in our workflow at the step they click 
- Comparing the conditional probability, we've seen strong corelation between the wrong click event and the cancel sign up event.

**R (Result)**:

- The UI team update the color schema based on my suggestion, the conversion rate (sign up rate) is increased.


##### BQ: tmat you faced a problem that had multiple possible solution


#### Management - Prioritize


##### BQ: tmat you sacrificed short term goal for long term success

- S:
    - 我们公司 Enquziit 是 AWS Provider, 我们的之前的主要业务是 Server Migration
    - 我们 expand 了我们的 business, 提供了 solution architect 以及 app mordernlization 的服务
- T:
    - 我们目前有两个地方可以投入 engineering 和 development 的资源:
        1. 进一步开发我们的 AMI Docker hardening pipeline, 以应对更多的 Migration 的需求.
        2. 开发标准化的 IAC 的 dev, test, delivery 的流程. 可以用于所有项目的 delivery.
- A:
    - 我选择了 2
    - 我认为选择 1, 我们会有更多的 billable unit, 能赚取利润.
    - 如果选择 2, 虽然这个项目不是 internal, non-billable, 但是研发成功后, 能让我们所有的项目共用一套 delivery 的流程, 1-2 个工程师即可负责所有项目的 delivery. 而不需要为每个 project 配备一个 engineer.
    - by choosing the second option, although it is not an externally bllable project, however it will benefit all projects. Now we only need 2 engineers for all projects, instead of sending engineers to each project.

#### Deal with Customer

##### BQ: How do you Train your cliient enquizit.com - 在 BLS 项目中 训练客户使用我们开发的软件

**S (Situation)**

BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics), Bureau 发音 (闭而肉)

BLS 委托 Enquizit 开发了一套数据分析系统, 其中包括 用来采集术的爬虫, 用来清理数据的 ETL pipeline, 以及用来储存数据的 DataLake.

作为 Data Architect 我的主要任务是 系统设计, 代码框架设计, 以及帮助开发者解决困难的具体实现问题. 在 POC 阶段完成之后, 大框架已经确定下来, 我的精力转向于维护部署, 以及培训客户.

--- 

BLS wants a 3-tier system to support their quarterly Consumer Price Index research. The system includes, Web Crawler to collect data, ETL Pipeline to transoform the data, and a Datalake to store and query the data.

My primary role as Data Architect is to make decision on System Design, Code Framework set up, and mentor developer to solve difficult implementation. After the POC phase (it is a three phase contract), I change my focus to maintaining the deployment and mentoring our customer.

**T (Task)**

客户 BLS 从来没有使用过 AWS 运行 Application, 所以他们需要我们对其进行培训以确保之后他们能顺利 Take Over 我们的 work.

--- 

This is BLS's first complex AWS Project. And by nature, the web crawler project is very complex. So BLS need a mentor to help their data scientist and developer.

**A (Action)**

1. I tried to become a trusted advisor and to build a close relationship with their engineering team.

- I meet the data scientist and engineering team as early in the customer lifecycle as I can.
- I am involved a lot in transition from implementation to go-live.
- (optional example): I helped a member of the customer with a problem that little bit beyond the scope of the contract.
- In these collaboration work, I showed them that I am be trusted as a very experienced engineer and problem solver.

2. I tailor the mentor strategy based on their knowledge level 

- To train their data scientist tool using AWS Service, I usually train them by providing simplified Proof of Concept (POC) example. Because Data scientist is unlike engineer, their primary knowledge is analytics skills, those tooling stuff is just for serving their primary task. They are system users, they just need to know how to use it by following an example.
- To train their engineer, I ususally give them a lot details and the deep consideration of the design. Because engineers are supposed to enbrance new technology more frequently and they need to be capable to add customization upon the system I delivery.

3. I prioritize the knowledge to meet customer's business outcome

- Because the capability to perform researchs on the Datalake is the most important business value for their Major Product - Consumer Price Index, I choose to provide moe example and adaptor code to boost up their data scientist team workflow.
- I focus on teaching the engineeering team how to deploy and maintain the web crawler for the most important dataset. And use this as a example to deal with other web crawler.

**R (Result)**

We have received very positive feed back that their engineer team are ganing new skills every sprint. And they want us to providing long term advisoring service after this contract.


#### Tough Question

##### BQ: Tell me about your WEAKNESS

**S (Situation)**:

I am very bad at memorizing things.

- In business meeting, I cannot call out the name of the person who just introduced himself.
- I highly depends on Calendar and Task Management software. If I am been told to do lots of things in sequence verbally, I easily forgot.
- Because my career goal is to become a software architect and a tech lead liked role. I have to be very versatile and super knowledgeable in many engineering topics. I feel like memorizing things becomes a big blocker to my career. I realized that in the second years of my second full time job, data scientist in EarthNetworks.

**T (Task)**:

- First of all, I take notes, especially in a business meeting with clients.
- I tried with categorizing my notes into many category, sub-category. But even doing data entry, and managing the catalog is a lot of efforts. And sometime it is still not easy to look up.
- I created GitHub repo tried to rewrite all kinds technique blogs 

**A (Action)**:

In order to solve this problem, I start thinking that, who is the people can memorize mass of information, and efficiently use it when needed. It's Google.

- I trained my self on purpose that be able to associate a topic, a link or a document with several distinguished words.

**R (Result)**:

- I came up a strategy using GitHub to index my knowledge for long term.
- I came up a full text search tools to manage my short term information, such as to do list, links, frequent used command, people information.


##### BQ: tmat when you FAILED

**S (Situation)**:

- Earthnetworks is a Smart Energy company that owns millions of portable weather sesnsor devices. By using that data, they could build energy management system to optimize energy usage and eventually reduce cost for business user.
- I was a Data Scientist there from 2014 to 2018.

**T (Task)**:

- My task is to build a **short term HVAC Consumption Prediction Machine Learning Model**.
- The key variable I am trying to predict is called **Runtime**. It is a thermodynamic terminology that reflects the heating and cooling behavior. it is a value from -1 ~ 1. basically if it is 1, it means your HVAC is trying super hard to cool down your house, if it is -1 it means your HVAC is heating up.
- I spent 2 months to build a **Random Forest Regressor Model**, it provides pretty accurate prediction in staging environment in the first 3 months.
- After that, the results **becomes very unstable and inaccruate** for a lots of small customers. So **we have to temporarily turn down the model**.

**A (Action)**:

Find the problem:

- The goal of this model is to predict HVAC behavior and energy consumption ahead of time so our control system can response ahead.
- I found that the variable, **Runtime represents how you feel about the HVAC status, but thermodynamically it doesn't reflects the energy consumption very well**.
- After consulting our thermodynamic reasearch guy, I figured it out that **I should predict the Heat Transfer instead of the Runtime**. Heat Transfer is another thermodynamic concepts that can derive energy consumption accurately, and also highly linearly related to other factors that we can easily get from sensors.

Take action to fix it:

- I evaluated the amount of effort to take to fix it, it takes about one month.
- instead of withdrawing the entire application, I asked the Software engineer to change the config that only provide 24 hours prediction, which can still provides reasonable prediction. And send our customer a letter about that.
- It takes me another 1 month to delivery the new model.

**R (Result)**:

What I learned from this failure:

- Thinking from perspective of engineer is never enough.
- Talk to other people related to this business line or the industry, see how people see it from different perspective.
- It reminds me to have **plan-B when the application not working**. For example using a thermodynamic mathematic model when the Machine Learning model not working. As I mentioned it breaks after 3 months of the deployment, I should have used the time to implement a plan B.

##### BQ: tmat you lead and failed

S:

- Enquizit 接到了一个 Contractor to support GSA DevSecOps team, improve the security of Server, Container Services
- Me and Two engineer

T:

- Build a pipeline to harden AMI for K8S to use. pipeline and ami hardening to meet CIS benchmark
- 我给 2 个 engineer 分配了活一个做 pipeline 一个做 hardening, 而 hardening 总有问题使得我们 backand force 的沟通, 导致 we are failed to delivery the AMI image.

A:

- to fix the problem, I spend a week working overtimely to fix and delivered the AMI
- from engineer perspective, we want to delivery a perfectly hardened AMI. from busieness perspective, they want a AMI to use. We focused to much on hardening other than building the pipeline
- from people manage perspective, the guy workinig on hardening actually doesn't like this task. I had talk after this failure, and I figured out that my engineers don't like this job as much as I do. As tech lead, I am exicited to add new skills and enrich my experience. But as engineer, they thought security is only about patching stuff and not creation.
- I tailored the

mich stephan kuma, shankar

##### BQ: tmat were not be able to meet time commitment

- What prevent you from doing it?
- What was the outcome and did you learn from it.

FDIC 项目中, 我设计了一个 Data Infrastructure 并靠设计拿到了合同. 然后接到了实现基础架构并迁徙一个 data source 到新的架构收上的任务. 我错误的估计了用时, 以为 2 周就可以完成.

但我在一周后发现, FDIC 的 AWS 账号管理很严格, 需要多次反复跟他们的 system admin 沟通, 以及要额外加入详细的 IAM 设定. 并且要被迁徙的 data source 的 endpoint 是一个 private endpoint, 需要额外的工作来配置验证, 这样就会导致无法按计划完成.

我赶紧跟对方的 product owner 汇报了, 并引用了将我跟他们的 system admin 技术讨论结果, 未能预测到的的工作量也得到了对方的 engineer 的证实.

由于我在还有一周 due 的时候跟对方及时沟通了, 我争取到了额外的 2 个礼拜, 最终成功的 delivery 了 app.

lesson:

1. 为我的客户设定一个准确的预期. 对于不确定的任务, 我的时间线需要有一个固定和变化的部分.
2. 早点失败比晚点失败好, 不要过度自信而在最后一刻去做事情, 有第二次机会总是好的.

**S (Situation)**:

- There's client FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Company) looking for a contractor team to maintaining their existing Hadoop and Python based Data Pipeline and re-architect the Data Pipeline on AWS Cloud.
- I proposed the proof-of-concept architect and migration planning, and got the contract.

**T (Task)**:

- As a Data Architect, I proposed the proof-of-concept architect and migration planning, and got the contract. The first task I got is to set-up the AWS Data Infrastructure and Migrate a single data source ETL process to the new architect. (Kinesis, Lambda, S3)

- Because I have done this before in my previous federal contract project, and I am the author of the cloudformation template for this solution, I was confident that I can delivery it in 2 weeks. And then I start connecting their system and AWS admin to start working on their AWS Account.

- Unlike doing development in Sandbox AWS account, a lots of resource and data in FDIC is very sensitive. And they have very restricted IAM Policy and Compliance Rules. I have to customize the IAM Policy parts and CI/CD pipeline part of my cloudformation template and contact FIDC system admin back and force many times. In addition, the endpoint data source is a private endpoint, there's additional work to manage credential, securely

I realized that I cannot meet the commitment at the end of first week.

**A (Action)**:

- I contacted the product owner of the client, referenced my technique discussion with system, evaluated and the new ETA, and eventually I earned 2 more weeks.

Finally, I successfully delivered the solution.

**R (Result)**:

1. Set the right expectation. For project with lots of uncertainty, then give my clients a timeline with a baseline and dynamic time range.
2. Fail early is better that failed at last minute. Because sometime I could be over confident and just trying to do it at last minutes. But I won't do it, because I always want a second chance.

## Tech Interview

### Data Engineer

#### Collectoin

#### Processing

#### Security

#### Analytics

#### Big Data

##### Q: What is High Availability?

1. High Availablity means no matter what happened, the system can still perform normally in 99.9999% of time. People call this ``up time``
2. We usually use ``Number of Nines`` to describe the level of high availability. For example ``4 of Nines`` means 99.9999% up time.
3. A Highly Available System usually has t:
    1. Distributive. It has to be a distribution System. Because A Single Node System can never be highly available.
    2. Fault Tolerance. The system can still provide service no matter any risk like power outage, network disconnection, server crash happens. Failure on a few of nodes in the distribution system won't stop the system.
    3. Scalability. The system is capable to adapt sudden and large change of the data traffic.


##### Q: What is Distrbutive

##### Q: What is Fault Tolerance

##### Q: What is Scalability

##### Q: How to Design a Highly Avaiable System

Let's use DynamoDB as example, assume that we are trying to design a highly available Key Value Store database.

1. **Fault Toleranec**: I want to define the terminology ``Shard``. Each ``Shard`` represent 3 Identical machine sharing a single URL endpoint. 1 machine is Major (master) taking the incoming traffic, 2 machine are Minor (slaves). These 3 machine keep sending heart beat signal to each other periodically, once the Major is detected offline, one of the Minor machine becomes Major and take over the incoming traffic.
2. **Data Consistancy**: Everytime the Major process a request, it copy the data change to the two Minor. Once the Major received the acknowledge from Minor that "We received the change". Then the Major send the commit signal to the two Minor, once the Major received the acknowledge from Minor that "We received the commit signal", then

##### Spark: How is Apache Spark different from MapReduce?

|                                 Apache Spark                                 |                                         MapReduce                                        |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|            Spark processes data in batches as well as in real-time           |                         MapReduce processes data in batches only                         |
|           Spark runs almost 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce           |          Hadoop MapReduce is slower when it comes to large scale data processing         |
| Spark stores data in the RAM i.e. in-memory. So, it is easier to retrieve it | Hadoop MapReduce data is stored in HDFS and hence takes a long time to retrieve the data |
|               Spark provides caching and in-memory data storage              |                              Hadoop is highly disk-dependent                             |

##### Spark: What are the important components of the Spark ecosystem?

Apache Spark has 3 main categories that comprise its ecosystem. Those are:

- Language support: Spark can integrate with different languages to applications and perform analytics. These languages are Java, Python, Scala, and R.
- Core Components: Spark supports 5 main core components. There are Spark Core, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, Spark MLlib, and GraphX.
- Cluster Management: Spark can be run in 3 environments. Those are the Standalone cluster, Apache Mesos, and YARN.

##### Spark: Explain how Spark runs applications with the help of its architecture.

This is one of the most frequently asked spark interview questions, and the interviewer will expect you to give a thorough answer to it.

##### Spark: What are the different cluster managers available in Apache Spark?

- Standalone Mode: By default, applications submitted to the standalone mode cluster will run in FIFO order, and each application will try to use all available nodes. You can launch a standalone cluster either manually, by starting a master and workers by hand, or use our provided launch scripts. It is also possible to run these daemons on a single machine for testing.
- Apache Mesos: Apache Mesos is an open-source project to manage computer clusters, and can also run Hadoop applications. The advantages of deploying Spark with Mesos include dynamic partitioning between Spark and other frameworks as well as scalable partitioning between multiple instances of Spark.
- Hadoop YARN: Apache YARN is the cluster resource manager of Hadoop 2. Spark can be run on YARN as well.
- Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

##### Spark: What is the significance of Resilient Distributed Datasets in Spark?

Resilient Distributed Datasets are the fundamental data structure of Apache Spark. It is embedded in Spark Core. RDDs are immutable, fault-tolerant, distributed collections of objects that can be operated on in parallel.RDD’s are split into partitions and can be executed on different nodes of a cluster.

RDDs are created by either transformation of existing RDDs or by loading an external dataset from stable storage like HDFS or HBase.


##### Spark: What is a lazy evaluation in Spark?

When Spark operates on any dataset, it remembers the instructions. When a transformation such as a map() is called on an RDD, the operation is not performed instantly. Transformations in Spark are not evaluated until you perform an action, which aids in optimizing the overall data processing workflow, known as lazy evaluation.

简单来说 transformation 的算子 比如 map 不会被立刻计算, 只有当你 action 的时候才会被计算.

##### Spark: tell me some Transformation 

- Map
- FlatMap list of list 的扁平化
- PartitionMap 处理一个分区的, 内存需要勾搭
- Sample
- Filter
- Union

##### Spark: What makes Spark good at low latency workloads like graph processing and Machine Learning?

Apache Spark stores data in-memory for faster processing and building machine learning models. Machine Learning algorithms require multiple iterations and different conceptual steps to create an optimal model. Graph algorithms traverse through all the nodes and edges to generate a graph. These low latency workloads that need multiple iterations can lead to increased performance.

##### Spark: What is shuffling in Spark? When does it occur?

Shuffling is the process of redistributing data across partitions that may lead to data movement across the executors. The shuffle operation is implemented differently in Spark compared to Hadoop. 

Shuffling has 2 important compression parameters:

spark.shuffle.compress – checks whether the engine would compress shuffle outputs or not spark.shuffle.spill.compress – decides whether to compress intermediate shuffle spill files or not

It occurs while joining two tables or while performing byKey operations such as GroupByKey or ReduceByKey
