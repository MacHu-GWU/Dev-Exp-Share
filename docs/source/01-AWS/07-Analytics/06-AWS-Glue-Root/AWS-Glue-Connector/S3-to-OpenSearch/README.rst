S3 to ElasticSearch in Glue
==============================================================================

.. note::

    If you turned on Lake Formation for Data Access Management. You need additional effort to grant IAM access to S3 location / Glue Catalog, which is a lot of effort.

    Since Lake Formation is a regional service, you can use a different region and make sure don't set up Lake Formation.
