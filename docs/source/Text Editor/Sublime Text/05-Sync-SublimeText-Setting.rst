Sync Sublime Text Setting
==============================================================================
All Sublime Text settings are stored inside the ``Sublime Text 3/Packages/User``.
In order to sync sublime text setting across computers, you just need to copy and past the ``User`` folder. After you have installed ``package control``, all packages will be automatically installed, and settings are all synced.

Where is the ``User`` folder?

- Windows: ``C:\Users\<your-username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\``
- MacOS: ``/Users/<your-username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/``
