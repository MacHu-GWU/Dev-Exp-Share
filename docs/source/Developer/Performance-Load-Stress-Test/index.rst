- Stress Test: running under very high load, find potential problem, see if performance goes down significantly

Method:

- Performance Test: test in different load situation
- Load Test: Gradually increase load, monitor KPI
- Stress Test: high load, running for long period of time

Simulate Prod Environment:

- Internet
